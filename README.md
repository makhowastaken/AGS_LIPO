# AGS_LIPO

LiPo adapter for Game Boy Advance SP. Same concept as my AGB adapters: https://github.com/makhowastaken/AGB_LIPO

Needs no extra parts beyond a battery itself. Order PCBs from OSHpark or download the PCB files here for using with your preferred fab. ENIG is highly recommended for this. https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/3R7Gl7s7

Works well with 603048 batteries: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33001664276.html (but there may be higher quality or cheaper options (or both))

For more info and for the install, see this youtube video: https://youtu.be/VjnONhSVvpA
