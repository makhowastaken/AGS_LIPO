# AGS_LIPO

LiPo adapter for Game Boy Advance SP. Same concept as my AGB adapters: https://github.com/makhowastaken/AGB_LIPO

Update 2020-10-17: Added v2.0 that is designed to work with a 3D printed frame to hold everything in place. Function is identical otherwise. 

Update 2020-05-09: Added text to solder mask layer to make markings (positive and negative side) more clear. No other changes made. 

One single board does not meet OSHpark's minimum PCB size requirement so I've uploaded two variants of the file, the single, regular version and then the same thing but I copy\pasted the same board into the file. This works for OSHpark but probably will not work for other fabs. 

Works well with 603048 batteries: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33001664276.html (but there may be higher quality or cheaper options (or both))

# V1.0

Needs no extra parts beyond a battery itself. Order PCBs from OSHpark or download the PCB files here for using with your preferred fab. ENIG is highly recommended for this. https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/gaB93JkC

This variant is intended for use with Retromodding's 3D printable bracket: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4624968
You can order PCBs with a Retromodding logo from the link RM shared: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/hciypfPv

Bonus, this battery mod also works perfectly in the original DS (as is) and the DS Lite (rotated) as picture below ([credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/hnpqkj/got_extra_lipos_and_makho_pcbs_fits_well_in_the/) from u/deep_size)
